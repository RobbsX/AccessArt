# AccessArt

ToDo:
- DONE Make sure that noone sees a picture twice. 
- DONE How to: Storing and retrieving Data from pods -> focus on how practical is this reading writing to pods in developing such an application
- Enable seeing what pods liked this picture. 
- Make function to button (dis)like click. Save img data and (Dis)Like to Users Pod.  

## Introduction

These days, apps use a centralised data storage. This enables ~97% Uptime​, efficient storage​, and creates a viable business model​. However, this also has some drawbacks: 
- Your OWN data is not freely available​ to you
- Data Leaks (massive expenses for companies)
- Legal Issues (GDPR)

However, users could also store their data themselves. The founder of the web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, founded the [SOLID project](https://solidproject.org) that enables users to have control over their data by storing it on their own POD. This pod can be your own server, or you use a trusted third-party. 

Sounds interesting? Right! But how does the developer site look like? That's what we try to figure out!

_Is creating a decentralized application a **viable** alternative to centralized?​_
Thus, the goal is to find out how complicated it is building an application using SOLID project​. 

The application: An app that shows artworks of Victoria & Alberthall Museum using their well-maintained API.

Framework



## Motivation


## What did we encounter? 

Some issues with linked data on apps using RDF is written on articles such as [this] (https://ontola.io/blog/full-stack-linked-data), where especially no ready solution is available to overcome the slowness that comes with loading all URL/URIs of the ressources in the background. 

### Storing and Getting Data from POD
CRUD. 
Create: createThing 
Read: getThing(All) as 
Update: ?
Delete: Easy to delete the whole SOLID dataset
